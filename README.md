# Fake-MSN

I made a fake MSN messenger a long time ago when MSN messenger was a thing.

this is a phishing msn messenger. So it sends the value of your input fields to my email.

This is solely for educational purposes and should not be used with people without their consent. Stealing information and people's personal data is against the law.

Feel free to download the zip file and look at the code.

This was made in visual basics.

To access the program /// Once download extra the files and go to this folder "messenger/bin/release/" and click on messenger.exe to run the program.
